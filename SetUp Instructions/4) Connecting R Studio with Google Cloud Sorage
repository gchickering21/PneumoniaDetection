Connecting R Studio with Google Cloud Storage

Step 1) You are going to need to download your account_credential.json and Oauthclient.json files from your Google Cloud Storage. Instructions on how to upload your account_credential.json file can be found here (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys). Once the file has been downloaded you will want to upload this file into the data-raw folder. In order to download your Oauthclient.json file you will follow a similar process that can be found here (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gargle/vignettes/get-api-credentials.html). Scroll down to the the "OAuth client ID and secret" section and download this json file as well. This file will also need to be put into your data-raw folder as well.
