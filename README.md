# STAT495-F20 final project

This is an individual GitHub repo for your final project.
My hope is that in addition to the assessment in STAT495 that this project might be used as a base for:

1. a public e-portfolio showcase of your work, and/or
2. a submission to the USRESP competition

In any case, I would encourage you to take care in terms of repo organization, naming, and structure.
