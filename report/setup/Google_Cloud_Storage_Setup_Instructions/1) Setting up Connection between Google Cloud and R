Connecting R Studio with Google Cloud Storage

Step 1) In order to get the data for this project, please log into your Google Cloud Storage account. Once logged in you will need to download your account_credential.json and Oauthclient.json files from your Google Cloud Storage. Instructions on how to upload your account_credential.json file can be found here (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys). Once the files has been downloaded you will want to upload this file into the report/setup folder. In order to download your Oauthclient.json file you will follow a similar process that can be found here (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gargle/vignettes/get-api-credentials.html). Scroll down to the the "OAuth client ID and secret" section and download this json file as well. This file will also need to be put into your report/setup folder as well.
