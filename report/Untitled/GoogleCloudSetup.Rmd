```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(googleCloudStorageR)
```

Here we check your buckets that are associated and available with your own personal account_credentials.
```{r}
gcs_auth(json_file="account_credentials.json")
gcs_list_buckets("image-analysis-detection")
```

This reads all the files that are stored in the google cloud storage bucket that you want to work with
```{r}
gcs_get_bucket("chest-xray-medical")
gcs_global_bucket("chest-xray-medical")
medical_objects <- gcs_list_objects() %>% mutate(id= row_number())
```

This is where we are going to actually copy all the images that are stored in the Google Cloud Storage Bucket into a space that can be used for this project
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gs_rsync(source="gs://chest-xray-medical", destination="STAT495F20-project-Chickering/data_raw", recursive=TRUE )
```
This just copied
